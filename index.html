    About me. I've been studing computer science since 9-th grade.
    I've started from olympiad programming but successfully <br> failed it[heh], and started participating more in
    scientific conferences and hackathons.
    <br>During schooltime I've won a lot of medals in these events furthermore not only at republican level, but
    worldwide as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    After school I've entered ITMO university in Russia,
    Saint Petersburg without exams as I won a special grant.
    <br>
